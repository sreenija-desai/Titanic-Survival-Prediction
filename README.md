# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Predicting who would have survived the Titanic disaster is a fascinating exercise that involves analyzing various factors such as passenger class, age, gender, and possibly other variables like traveling alone or with family. One common approach is to use machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model based on historical data. Here's a simplified overview of how you could approach this:

# Data Collection:
Gather a dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, including whether they survived or not, as well as relevant features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, etc.
# Data Preprocessing:
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones (using techniques like one-hot encoding), and scaling numerical features if necessary.
# DATASET
The data has been split into two groups:

# training set (train.csv)
# test set (test.csv)
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
